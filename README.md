# Questle - A wordle-clone math guessing game

A project bootstrapped with Create-React-App

## Available Scripts

To begin the Application, I recommend running 

### 'npm install' 

within the directory, as this will install all relevant and neccesary dependencies. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

This is the main way to access the app if you want to debug, edit or run any kind of extra code.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
An already made build can be found in the "release" branch. I do recommend building it yourself, however.
